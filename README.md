This project uses Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques to analyze movie reviews and classify them as either positive or negative. The main goal is to build a machine learning model that can understand the sentiment behind written text, allowing automated analysis of public opinion based on movie reviews.

Project Highlights
Data Preprocessing: Cleaning, tokenization, stopword removal, and vectorization of textual data.

Model Training: Machine learning algorithms (e.g., Logistic Regression, Naive Bayes, etc.) used for training on labeled data.

Evaluation: Performance metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and confusion matrix used to evaluate model effectiveness.

Prediction: The trained model can classify new, unseen reviews into positive or negative sentiment.
